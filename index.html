<h2>   What we do</h2>
<p>
Our services include tree topping to manage tree height safely, tree felling for the removal of hazardous or unwanted trees, 
and hedge trimming/cutting to maintain your garden’s neat and healthy appearance. 
We also provide thorough roof and gutter cleaning to prevent water damage and ensure proper drainage.
Lastly, our power washing service restores the exterior of your home or business, removing dirt, mold, and grime for a fresh, clean look. 
</p>
<h2>Powerwashing </h2>
<p>
Power washing is an effective way to restore and refresh the exterior of your home or business.
Over time, dirt, grime, mold, and mildew can accumulate on surfaces such as driveways, patios, siding, and decks. 
Our power washing service uses high-pressure water to safely clean and rejuvenate these surfaces, removing built-up debris and leaving your property looking as good as new. 
</p>
<br>
<h2>Tree Topping</h2>
<p>
Tree topping is a method used to reduce the height or size of a tree by cutting back the top branches.
This service is ideal for homeowners looking to maintain tree health, improve aesthetics, or reduce the risk of damage during storms. 
While tree topping can enhance safety and visibility, it's important that it be performed by professionals to avoid harming the tree. 
We at Plalor use proper techniques to ensure the longevity of your trees while keeping them well-managed and safe.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Hedge Trimming/Cutting</h2>
<p>
Hedge trimming and cutting is key to keeping your garden looking neat and tidy.
Regular trimming ensures healthy growth and a well-manicured appearance, preventing overgrowth that can obscure views or create a mess. 
Whether you have decorative hedges or privacy hedges, we provide expert cutting and shaping services to enhance the beauty and health of your plants. 
We also ensure precision and care in every job to maintain your hedges in top condition year-round.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Roof/Gutter cleaning</h2>
<p>
Regular roof and gutter cleaning is essential for maintaining the integrity of your home.
Clogged gutters can lead to water damage, leaks, and even structural issues if left unchecked. 
We provide thorough roof and gutter cleaning services, removing debris, leaves, and moss, ensuring proper water flow and preventing costly repairs. 
By keeping your gutters clear and your roof in great shape, you can avoid future headaches and protect your property.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Tree Felling</h2>
<p>
Tree felling is the process of completely removing a tree from your property.
This is often necessary when a tree is diseased, poses a risk to buildings or power lines, or simply needs to be removed for aesthetic reasons. 
We have the necessary tools and experience to safely fell trees, ensuring that it’s done in the safest and most efficient manner possible. 
We also take good care to avoid any damage to surrounding landscapes and dispose of the tree properly.
